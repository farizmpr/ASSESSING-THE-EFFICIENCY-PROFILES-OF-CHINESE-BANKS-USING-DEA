# ASSESSING-THE-EFFICIENCY-PROFILES-OF-CHINESE-BANKS-USING-DEA

## Project Goals

This project aims to assess the efficiency profiles of Chinese commercial banks utilizing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). We intend to conduct a critical analysis and classification of past studies within the context of bank restructuring and efficiency optimization. The project seeks to identify methodological gaps, analyze diverse efficiency models, and explore the impact of regulatory, technological, and economic changes on banking operations. By integrating various DEA methodologies and multiple efficiency measurements, we strive to provide a comprehensive analysis that enhances understanding and supports strategic decisions in the banking sector. Future directions include the application of advanced DEA models to evaluate dynamic network interactions and address environmental heterogeneities, thereby improving the precision and applicability of our findings to real-world banking challenges.
